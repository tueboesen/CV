%My main scientific focus areas are currently: machine learning and protein folding.
%More specifically, within machine learning, I have worked extensively with equivariant and graph-based networks, as well as transfer and self-supervised learning.
%The goal of my work in machine learning has always been to fundamentally understand how neural networks work, which I believe is best done by connecting them with well-established areas of mathematics.
%Parts of this work lead to mimetic neural networks, and constrained neural networks, both of which are novel ideas in machine learning that has given me a deeper understanding of neural networks and allows me to more effectively tailor neural network to specific problems.

My main hobbies outside work are boardgames, rock climbing and beach volley.
Apart from those I like to tinker with various projects, my current project is to {\href{https://github.com/tueboesen/Boardgame_AI}{develop a framework}} that can play various boardgames, while previous ones include: building a quadcopter, and designing and building a hangboard with a CNC machine and laser cutter.
