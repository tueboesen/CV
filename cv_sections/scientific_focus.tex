My main scientific focus areas are currently: machine learning and protein folding. More specifically, within machine learning, I have worked extensively with equivariant and graph-based networks, as well as transfer and self-supervised learning. The goal of my work in machine learning has always been to fundamentally understand why neural networks work, which I believe is best done by connecting them with well-established areas of mathematics. This lead to mimetic neural networks, and constrained neural networks.
