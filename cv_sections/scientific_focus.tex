My main scientific focus areas are currently: machine learning and protein folding.
More specifically, within machine learning, I have worked extensively with equivariant and graph-based networks, as well as transfer and self-supervised learning.
The goal of my work in machine learning has always been to fundamentally understand how neural networks work, which I believe is best done by connecting them with well-established areas of mathematics.
Parts of this work lead to mimetic neural networks, and constrained neural networks, both of which are novel ideas in machine learning and has lead to a deeper understanding of how I think about neural networks.
